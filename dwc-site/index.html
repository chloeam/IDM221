          The Drexel Writing Center (DWC) helps all members of the Drexel community think through and develop their writing projects, primarily through one-on-one consultations with Peer and Faculty Readers. With a tutoring staff that spans a wide variety of disciplines, the DWC is a place of cross-disciplinary work where readers and writers learn from each other.

        </blockquote>
        <blockquote>
          With a near perfect GPA, I didn't think my writing could be improved, but I was wrong.
        </blockquote>
        <blockquote>
          My tutor understood my needs and helped me to organize my ideas. I felt like a weight had been lifted off my shoulders because the assignment no longer seemed so daunting and intimidating.

        <p>
          The DWCâ€™s mission is to help all members of the Drexel community develop as writers. We provide individualized support for writers working on any kind of writing&mdash;assignments, personal statements, articles for publication, personal projects, etc. We welcome writers at any stage in the writing process&mdash;from brainstorming to final revision. Our philosophy is rooted in the belief that all writers benefit from talking about their work. These conversations about writing are often collaborative in nature and spur critical thinking. Writing center tutors, called Readers, are highly trained professionals who will provide you with a close and critical reading of your writing and give you honest feedback based on their observations and your goals for project. We believe that members of the Drexel community are hard working and talented, and we respect your right to make choices about your writing.
