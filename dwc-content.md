## Who We Are

The Drexel Writing Center (DWC) helps all members of the Drexel community think through and develop their writing projects, primarily through one-on-one consultations with Peer and Faculty Readers. The Center is part of the University Writing Program and is managed by Janel McCloskey, assistant director of the University Writing Program, and Krysten Voelkner ’16, operations manager. With a tutoring staff that spans a wide variety of disciplines, the DWC is a place of cross-disciplinary work where readers and writers learn from each other.

### What Drexel Students Are Saying

> “Great tool for anyone wishing to improve their writing!”

> “…My tutor understood my needs and helped me to organize my ideas. I felt like a weight had been lifted off my shoulders because the assignment no longer seemed so daunting and intimidating.”

> “With a near perfect GPA, I didn’t think my writing could be improved, but I was wrong.”

### Mission Statement

The DWC’s mission is to help all members of the Drexel community develop as writers. We provide individualized support for writers working on any kind of writing — assignments, personal statements, articles for publication, personal projects, etc. We welcome writers at any stage in the writing process — from brainstorming to final revision. Our philosophy is rooted in the belief that all writers benefit from talking about their work. These conversations about writing are often collaborative in nature and spur critical thinking. Writing center tutors, called Readers, are highly trained professionals who will provide you with a close and critical reading of your writing and give you honest feedback based on their observations and your goals for project. We believe that members of the Drexel community are hard working and talented, and we respect your right to make choices about your writing.

## Frequently Asked Questions

#### Do I need to have a finished paper to come in?

No, you don’t need to have a finished paper, a drafted paper, or even a paper at all. The Writing Center is happy to help you no matter what stage of writing you’re at. Whether you need to put the finishing touches on your work or you’re still brainstorming, the readers at the Writing Center are more than happy to help.

#### Is an online appointment just as good as an in-person appointment?

In order to provide our services to those who might not be able to come to an in-person session, our online system was recently upgraded to use microphones and webcams during a session, similar to a Skype session. Meetings take place with the same readers who would conduct in-person sessions.

#### How do I know where my appointment will be?

The location of your appointment immediately follows your reader’s name. For example, a tutor in the Writing Center would be listed as John (MacAlister 0032), while a tutor in the library might be Jane (Hagerty 127).

#### Can I make more than one appointment?

Yes, students are allowed to make up to two appointments per week. They can be scheduled at any available time is most convenient for you, so long as the second appointment does not directly follow the first. On the Graduate Support Program, writers can only have one appointment per week.

#### Will my reader review my grammar?

Potentially, however we often find that grammar is not the most pressing concern when working on improving writing. Our readers are trained to focus on broader issues, like making sure that there is a strong thesis guiding the paper, coherence throughout the paper, clarity, and so on. It is usually more appropriate to address grammar near the end of the writing process, and even then it is not always productive to focus strictly on grammar.

#### Do readers at the Writing Center copyedit papers?

Rather than copyedit, we prefer to help you revise your paper. Copyediting involves looking for mostly surface level details, and an appointment is usually better spent examining and improving deeper aspects of a paper instead of just polishing the surface. Also, appointments at the Writing Center are cooperative experiences, and copyediting is a very one-sided process. The paper may be improved slightly, but copyediting leads to very little growth as a writer. Readers may be able to give you tips to help you edit on your own, but they will not edit your paper for you.

#### Do I need to be present while the reader goes over my paper?

Yes, appointments at the Writing Center are conducted as conversations. Your reader will involve you in the process, and their understanding of your writing as well your own understanding will be advanced through discussion. By working together with someone, you can appreciate aspects of your writing you may otherwise miss if you were just going through the paper on your own.

#### Do you only review essays?

Many of our appointments focus on formal essays, but we’re more than happy to review any written work with you. Students often bring in drafts, presentations, reports, or just come in to brainstorm and plan how they will write their essays.

#### Will the Writing Center be able to help with papers like lab reports?

Yes, tutors are trained to help in all disciplines. Additionally, not all readers are English majors. Although some readers do study English, the majority comes from other majors across the University, such as business and engineering. As a result, we have a very broad experience base to draw upon.
