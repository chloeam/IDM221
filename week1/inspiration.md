## [Stripe](https://stripe.com/)

I love this site for a lot of reasons, but the first thing that comes to mind is that it doesn't get stuck in the rut of looking like it follows a typical HTML structure. HTML and CSS are box-based, but this site uses a lot of triangles, circles, diagonal elements that break the grid, and other geometric shapes that look like they fall outside of the box model.

The design is so effective in that it beautifully extends the Stripe band, but what impresses me more are all the subtle details that really seem to *make* the site. When you hover over a button, for example, it raises slightly, the color changes, and the drop shadow darkens slightly. When you hover over the "explore the stack" button at the top of the site, the icon animates and morphs into an arrow. When you hover over the main nav at the top, the submenu comes up as an animated rectangle (which I think works much better than the typical submenu), and animates again as you switch your hover from one menu item to another. As you scroll down the page, you see these little animations that are subtle, but just add a level of polish and intentionality to the site that makes it feel more immersive.

## [Philadelphia Museum of Art](http://www.philamuseum.org/)

I like some things about this site (like the fact that the address and hours are so easily accessible in the footer), but I think that overall, they could've done a much better job with it. The buttons and popovers look like an older version of Bootstrap's default style, and the PMA could've personalized them a bit more. Additionally, when I think of what an art museum's website *should* be, I think of big, beautiful photography showcasing the current exhibits rotating in a carousel. The photos the PMA has are small and not particularly vibrant.

## [Charles and Thorn](http://www.charlesandthorn.com/)

This website is incredibly simple but absolutely gorgeous and very effective. Even though the site isn't particularly interactive or dynamic, the focus on their designs is very appropriate and showcases their work.

I also really like how the social media icons at the bottom behave. It's never made sense to me how on so many sites, when you hover over a photo or icon it gets more transparent, so I like how when you hover over an icon on this site, the rest fade slightly so the icon you're hovering over is at the forefront.

The one thing I would change about this site is on the [about](http://www.charlesandthorn.com/about/) page: the type across columns doesn't align. I know aligning to the baseline is pretty hard with CSS, but I think it's especially important to have beautifully handled typography on a site for print designers.
